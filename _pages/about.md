I am currently a PhD student at [VSLab](http://vslab.ia.ac.cn/en/#about) of the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science ([CASIA](http://english.ia.cas.cn)), under the supervision of [Prof. Bing Li](http://www.ia.cas.cn/sourcedb_ia_cas/cn/iaexpert/201707/t20170715_4833365.html) and [Prof. Weiming Hu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huweiming?language=en). I also work closely with [Prof. Jin Gao](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~jgao?language=en). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://www.hust.edu.cn)). My research interests are efficient and brain-inspired vision algorithms, especially for their application to visual tracking. My research goal is to enable fast, robust, and human-like perception for machines.  

Feel free to drop me an email if you have questions about our work or are interested in cooperation.
